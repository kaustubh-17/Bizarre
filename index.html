        <h2><a href="#">The geometry that has baffled mankind since ages: Nazca Lines</a></h2>
	
        <iframe width = "680" height = "380" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWIYb5zd6p8" frameborder = "0" allow = "autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	
<p>The Nazca Lines are a collection of giant geoglyphs—designs or motifs etched into the ground—located in the Peruvian coastal plain about 250 miles (400 kilometers) south of Lima, Peru. Created by the ancient Nazca culture in South America, and depicting various plants, animals, and shapes, the 2,000-year-old Nazca Lines can only be fully appreciated when viewed from the air given their massive size.<span id = "dots0">.....</span><span id="more0">The Nazca Lines are perhaps best known for the representations of about 70 animals and plants, some of which measure up to 1,200 feet (370 meters) long. Examples include a spider, hummingbird, cactus plant, monkey, whale, llama, duck, flower, tree, lizard and dog.
<br>
<br>
The Nazca people also created other forms, such as a humanoid figure (nicknamed “The Astronaut”), hands and some unidentifiable depictions. Additionally, there are over 300 geometric designs, which include basic shapes such as triangles, rectangles, and trapezoids, as well as spirals, arrows, zig-zags and wavy lines. There are more than 800 straight lines on the coastal plain, some of which are 30 miles (48 km) long. In 2011, a Japanese team discovered a new geoglyph that appears to represent a scene of decapitation, which, at about 4.2 meters long and 3.1 meters wide, is far smaller than other Nazca figures and not easily seen from aerial surveys. The Nazca people were known to collect “trophy heads,” and research in 2009 revealed that the majority of trophy skulls came from the same populations as the people they were buried with (rather than outside cultures).

In 2016, the same team found another geoglyph, this time one that depicts a 98-foot-long (30-meter-long) mythical creature that has many legs and spotted markings, and is sticking out its tongue. Despite being studied for over 80 years, the geoglyphs—which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1994—are still a mystery to researchers.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">The beast on the Scotland shores: Stronsay Legend</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Scotland</a></span> </div>
        <p>Although stories of sea serpents, and mythical sea-dwellers, abound in Orkney, there have actually been a surprising number of documented, historical creature "sightings" that have now entered the lore of the islands. Scotland seems to have the sea beasts on "loch." Not only do they have the now infamous tales of The Loch Ness Monster, but, back in 1808, <span id = "dots">.....</span><span id="more">a strange carcass washed up on the shores of Stronsay that many believe to be another Plesiosaurus. Scientists speculate that it was a 36-foot-long decaying basking shark, but do basking sharks have paw-like fins with articulating joints, like the eyewitnesses reported seeing on the creature? And the mystery doesn't end there.

Even if the Stronsay Beast was nothing more than a dead basking shark, an element of mystery still surrounds the saga.

The longest recorded basking shark measured a mere 40 feet - 15 feet smaller than the remains of the Stronsay Beast. At 55 feet long from tip to tail, the shark that decomposed to form the Stronsay Beast must have been a monster in its own right.

So was the Stronsay Beast really a shark? Or is there another explanation? An unknown species of giant shark perhaps?

With all tales such as these, sometimes it's better not to know.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">Mystery of Roopkund (Lake)</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">India</a></span> </div>
        <p>The amazing feature of Roopkund that draws a large number of tourists to this remote rough terrain - a god-forsaken area is the presence of human skeletal remains  in the shallow lake (the depth may be around seven feet). The skeletons become visible at its bottom when the snow melts in the warm summer  months. Also found are animal skeletal remains. The lake remains frozen for eight long months in a year.<span id = "dots1">.....</span><span id="more1"><br><br>It all begins in 1942, British forest guard H K Madhwal found skeleton floating in the lake at 16000 feet above the sea-level. British officials feared, that the skeletons were of Japanese invasion force during World War II, but the skeletons were too old, couldn’t be Japanese Soldiers.
In 1956, Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology at Hyderabad made the first attempt to take samples and conduct DNA test to reveal the mystery to the world. They found two sets of skeletons, one, tall Iranian type, and other, short locals. Did Iranian group trying to cross the Roopkund with the help of locals? But it resulted in another puzzle, why and what is the motivation?
Later in 2004, a team of scientists conducted series of test, revealed that the skeletons belong to 9th Century and of two different groups of people. Short skeletons are of the locals and DNA from taller ones matched closely with that of Konkanastha Brahmins (Chitpavans) from Maharashtra. What is the reason for so many human skeletons in one place at the bottom of the lake that too in an area far  away from human habitation?  Considerable research was done on the skeletal remains and researchers have  firmly concluded that the skeletons are the remains of people who were suddenly caught and killed in a sudden, violent hailstorm presumably in the 9th century.

          <h3><a href="#">The bizarre manuscript at Yale University vault</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Italy</a></span>
	</div>
<p>The Voynich Manuscript is likely what cryptologists call a cipher, or a coded pattern of letters. Written in Central Europe in the 15th century, the book is slightly larger than a modern paperback and contains 246 fragile pages of bound vellum, or script-ready animal skin. It doesn't include an index but likely had foldouts that have long since gone missing. There are gaps in the page numbers and evidence that it could have been rebound at some point, so the order of the pages today may be different than they were when the book was published.<span id = "dots2">.....</span><span id="more2">We know, owing to carbon dating, that it was put together in the early fifteenth century. But no living person has ever, as far as we know, understood it. Nobody can decode the language the book is written in. It has no title and no author. A new facsimile, edited by Raymond Clemens and published by Yale University Press, draws attention to the way that we think about truth now: the book invites guesses, conspiracy theory, spiritualism, cryptography.<br><br>The book was made in the ordinary medieval way, but the script—the form of its letters, the language itself—was apparently invented by whoever made it. Some call the language and its script “Voynichese.” The letters loop prettily, and the text runs from left to right, top to bottom. The book’s historical trail vanishes in 1670, up until the time that Voynich (Wilfrid Michael Voynich, who bought the manuscript, in 1912) purchased it. Nonetheless, the Voynich Manuscript has charisma, and charisma has lately held a monopoly on our attentions.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">Mysteries underneath the Mariana Trench</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Pacific Ocean</a></span> </div>
        <p>To even comprehend all the weird stuff that’s going on in the Mariana Trench, we must first understand its sheer size. The Mariana Trench is the deepest point in all of our oceans, coming in at 36,201 feet deep. That's right, you could stick Mt. Everest on the bottom and it would be covered by water with an extra 7,000 feet on top. Because of the sheer size and pressure, only four expeditions have successfully descended.<span id = "dots3">.....</span><span id="more3"><br><br>One of the strangest things that have emanated from the Mariana Trench hasn’t been a frightening sea monster, but a mysterious “bio-metallic” sound that sometimes emanates from the trench is heard. Marine researchers have dubbed this almost mechanical, “twangy” noise “Western Pacific Biotwang,” and it first turned up in 2014 when scientists recorded ocean sounds near the Mariana Trench with diving robots called “passive acoustic ocean gliders.” Apart from it, when scientists managed to capture audio from the deepest ocean pit on the planet in 2016, things got all sorts of creepy. Recordings showed that the area was actually chock-full of sounds, including screeches, moans and rumbles. Another stuff that baffles geologists are massive mud volcanoes, spewing hot mud and rock fragments from the depths of the earth to the depths of the sea. Such natural structures exist within the Mariana Trench, which exists in a spot where the Pacific tectonic plate is pushed downwards by the Philippine Sea Plate. This makes the area a hotspot of volcanic activities as well.</span></p>
