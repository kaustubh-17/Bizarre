        <h2><a href="#">The unfounded 'something' beneath Hagia Sophia</a></h2>

<p>LP O’Bryan, who describes himself as a crime & mystery writer, has written a thought provoking article about the possibility of ‘something’ being under Hagia Sophia. His  argument is that Crypts and underground structures were common in churches prior to the time of the construction of Hagia Sophia,so why is it that there are no underground structures? Perhaps there are some<span id = "dots0">.....</span><span id="more0"> that we have yet to discover. Can modern technology help us? If there are some hidden underground structures under the Holy Wisdom, what might they contain?<br><br>
The intricate mosaics here appear to tell a tale. Apart from mosaics, the waters of panacea here once attracted the ill. Until the Hagia Sophia was opened as a museum, many visitors flocked here to drink from two water wells, hailed for their purported healing powers. It was said that if you drank three times in a row, on Saturdays, from the well in the main hall, you would be cured of illness. There are hundreds of other legends about this subject. Tombs of saints, a giant cistern which a galleon can sail in it, tunnels which goes through all the Constantinople’s underground, tunnels extend till Princess Islands ( Kınalı ), the crypto room which keeps all the secret correspondences with the celebrants around the empire in Hagia Sophia which was Vatican of that time, the jewelry which was thrown away when the notables of the city understood that the city would be lost, the materials which were suggested as celestial because they were used in church and weren’t thrown away and embedded in these tunnel and the list goes on. Legends speak about such places under Hagia Sophia, one talks about the devil being imprisoned there, but that isn’t proof that any such place exists. The only thing that will prove the existence or non existence of such features is a proper geophysical survey using ground penetrating radar and the latest magnetometer equipment.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">Mysterious species beneath Ross Sea Ice Shelf</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Antarctica</a></span> </div>
        <p>A few intrepid research teams have drilled hundreds of metres through the world’s largest ice shelf and found a mysterious collection of species living underneath, including fish and crustaceans. The group of scientists were testing an underwater robot when they stumbled across never before seen sea anemones and peculiar upside-down swimming fish. No one yet knows how 
<span id = "dots">.....</span><span id="more">they got there or how they survive such extreme conditions, however, these elusive creatures may have considerable implications for astrobiology, as scientists think that the Antarctic ice shelf has similar conditions to Europa, one of Jupiter’s moons, indicating extra-terrestrial life may be able to survive in such a frosty environment. Although very little is known about these elusive sea creatures, the researchers are hoping to return to the ice shelf with a redesigned robot to study them further.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">The famous conspiracy of Devil's Triangle</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">North Atlantic Ocean</a></span> </div>
        <p>Named for the triangular shape of around 500,000 square miles of ocean between Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico, the Bermuda/Devil's Triangle is one of the most notorious sea legends. When Christopher Colombus first sailed the area he claimed to see a giant ball of light in the sky that crashed into the horizon and made it glow. Soon, all sorts of strange <span id = "dots1">.....</span><span id="more1">events began being claimed in the area, including several boats disappearing with no one radioing in a distress signal, and in one incident in 1945, an entire squadron of US torpedo bombers vanished into thin air.<br><br>Among the few proposed scientific explanation, the more popular is the theory of electromagnetic interference that causes compass problems. This theory claims that there is a very high pull of the earth’s natural magnet which redirects the compass and other sophisticated equipment, and disallows them to take their intended route through the waters. However, till now, no single theory has offered a concrete explanation to this unanswered conspiracy.
