        <h2><a href="#">Twin Mystery at Kodinhi: 220 sets of twins growing in one village</a></h2>

<p>Among the most mysterious things going on in the world, the news of 220 sets of twins growing up in a village in India is very astounding. The doctors in India are wracking their brains to solve the riddle of 220 plus twins born to 2,000 families in the far-flung village of Kodinhi in Kerala. Experts are wondering at the uncommon phenomenon of twin births which is nearly six times more than the global average. In 2008, 300 women 
<span id = "dots0">.....</span><span id="more0"> delivered healthy babies and, out of those deliveries, 15 pairs of twins were born in the village.<br><br>As per the population census, 60 pairs of twins were born in the past five years in Kodinhi village. Apparently, the rate of twins is increasing with every passing year, and is expected to break the previous records in 2017. The villagers say that the incidences of delivering twins began three generations back. Expressing his excitement over the medical significance of the case of ever-growing number of twins, Dr.Sribiju says, “To the best of my knowledge, this medical marvel began somewhere between 60 to 70 years ago.” A joint team comprising researchers from various institutions in India, Germany, and the U.K. has started collecting saliva samples from the twins of Kodinhi village, near Tirurangadi, to isolate their DNA, in a bid to find out why so many twins are born here. The researchers will pool in the data collected from the four twin communities and subject them to a deeper analyses. The results are likely to throw interesting light on a riddle that the world has been watching with much curiosity until now.

Although local people tend to ascribe many reasons for high twinning in the four global communities, none of them had any scientific backing. “Until today, no studies have provided scientific rationale for twinning in specific populations,” said Prof. Preetham.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">The Creepy Copper Scroll</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Dead Sea</a></span> </div>
        <p>A treasure tale that will probably never be resolved is more ancient. In 1952 a copper scroll was found by archaeologists in a cave, along with other Dead Sea Scrolls, at the site of Qumran. As its name suggests, the writing was engraved onto a copper scroll. The scroll records a vast amount of hidden gold and silver treasure — so much, in fact, that some scholars believe that it is  
<span id = "dots">.....</span><span id="more">impossible for it to exist. 

The scroll dates back more than 1,900 years to a time when the Roman Empire controlled the Qumran area. There were a number of revolts against Roman rule at the time the scroll was written, and scientists have hypothesized that the treasure was hidden to prevent its capture by Roman forces. Whether the treasure is real, where exactly it was hidden, whether it was ever found and whether it could still exist today are all mysteries that will likely never be solved.</span></p>

          <h3><a href="#">Did Cleopatra's tomb vanished?</a></h3>
          <span class="category"><a href="#">Egypt</a></span> </div>
        <p>Ancient writers claim that Cleopatra VIIand her lover, Mark Antony, were buried together in a tomb after their deaths in 30 B.C. The writer Plutarch (A.D. 45-120) wrote that the tomb was located near a temple of Isis, an Egyptian goddess, and was a "lofty and beautiful" monument containing treasures made of gold, silver, emeralds, pearls, ebony and ivory.<span id = "dots1">.....</span><span id="more1">The location of the tomb remains a mystery. In 2010, Zahi Hawass, Egypt's former antiquities minister, conducted excavations at a site near Alexandria now called Taposiris Magna, which contains a number of tombs dating to the era when Cleopatra VII ruled Egypt. While many interesting archaeological discoveries were made, Cleopatra VII's tomb was not among them Hawass reported in a series of news releases. Archaeologists have noted that even if Cleopatra's tomb does survive to this day, it may be heavily plundered and unidentifiable.
